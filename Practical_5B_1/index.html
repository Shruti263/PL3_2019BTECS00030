                        <p>Solana has been a trending topic due to the successive weeks of price increases seen by its SOL token. At the time of writing, SOL traded at around $207, which is an 11,400% surge from less than $2 back in January. At its present worth, Solana sits among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization with about $60 billion, claiming the sixth spot from Dogecoin (DOGE), according to Cointelegraph Markets.

                            One of the likely catalysts of this bullish momentum is funding from investors led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain in June. Solana secured $314 million, which will be used to further its technology in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena. Notably, the investment took the form of SOL coin purchases rather than traditional equity shares.
                            
                            Another key reason for Solana’s SOL price boom is the announcement of its fourth hackathon event slated for Oct. 8. Hackathons are targeted at developers whose projects are entered into a competition for a chance to win cash prizes and seed funding opportunities. This was perceived as a positive move for Solana, as it could help achieve wider adoption of its technology.

                            <div class="points">What is Solana?</div>
                            Solana is a layer-one blockchain network that can implement smart contracts. Founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former Qualcomm senior staff engineer manager, Solana is billed as the solution to the scaling issues of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Two years after its founding, Solana was able to land $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Multicoin Capital.

                            While Bitcoin (BTC) is widely accepted as a peer-to-peer form of money, Ethereum, on the other hand, is the platform for turning almost everything peer-to-peer. Solana is in the same league as Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and layer-one infrastructure, but it brings along several other propositions.

                            Ethereum is still the top choice for building decentralized applications (DApps) and deploying smart contracts, but it can’t be denied that it’s plagued with legacy issues that it's trying to refine over time.
                            
                            <div class="points">An Ethereum killer?</div>
                            Despite Ethereum being the superior network — with 7,000 nodes and 90,000 validators, compared with Solana’s 600 nodes and 1,000 validators — Solana is still dubbed an “Ethereum killer.” A large part of this is due to how its innovations address the perceived weaknesses in Ethereum.

                            Through the aforementioned PoH consensus in which validators maintain their own clock, transaction verification is cut short, as nodes no longer have to put in processing power to verify various timestamps. This improves the speed at which transactions are processed. Solana claims that it can process up to 60,000 transactions per second, which is a far cry from what Ethereum and even Bitcoin, Visa and XRP combined can offer.
                            Can Ethereum compete with Solana in the long run?
                            The question now is: Can Solana outdo the blockchain platforms of the top two altcoins? Ethereum 2.0 isn’t expected until sometime next year, as Phase 2 of the upgrade’s timeline is until late 2021 or early 2022. With the upgrade, proponents believe that transactions on Ethereum could be much cheaper and could even reach 100,000 per second, or more.

                            In spite of that, Solana’s design architecture allows it to keep pace, as it is theoretically made to scale with Moore’s law. This means that as computers become faster over time, so will Solana. Essentially, Solana is future-proofing itself through its scaling capabilities. If this proves to be the case, will Solana be the culprit for taking an ax to Ethereum?
